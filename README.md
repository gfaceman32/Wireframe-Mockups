<h3> 2 mockups for Cuban Pete's homepage </h3>

<h> The client (Cuban Pete’s is a Latin eatery nestled in Montclair, NJ’s “restaurant row” area) has asked me to appraise its website. 



S: Cuban Pete’s has a bigger identity than typical non-franchised restaurants. The green, mustard and rust akimbo-arranged font adds a level of genuineness to the site experience. The free-spirited style of the font seems to indicate that Cuban Pete’s is, if nothing else, a fun place to patronize. 

Cuban Pete, the mascot (a generic character in an oversized sombrero) while a bit cheesy, is just another unique identifier that helps the establishment stand out. 

W: Although Cuban Pete’s has established it’s look and equipped itself with “a memorable” mascot, the site doesn’t execute the display of these strengths well. The homepage is poorly proportioned. The bulk of the information is corralled in the center of the page. The icons for the options “Flash Site” or “Mobile Site” are rendered well but essentially misused and unneeded.  There are inexplicable bars running horizontal through the page and poorly appointed “Watch Video” and Facebook buttons.

O: Since we’ve established that Cuban Pete’s is a definitive hotspot (business is good; standing room only on weekends) then we simply need the web presence to match the actuality. The potential to bring in newer patrons may result in the need to open a Cuban Pete’s Two (or Too).

T: The current strength is the strength of the product and word of mouth advertising. A potential threat is a nearby restaurant opening in Cuban Pete’s proximity that may have an equally strong menu but superior web presence </h>
